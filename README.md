# roam-scrollbars: a Roam Research extension to show and customize scrollbars.

## Introduction

The default CSS loaded by Roam [doesn't show scrollbars](https://github.com/paulovieira/roam-scrollbars/issues/1). This is not a problem on macOS because the scrollbars are shown automatically when scrolling is happening. But on Windows and Linux, it is! This extension solves that problem by adding a little bit of minimal css to show the scrollbars again.

This extension also allows you to configure some aspects of scrollbars in Roam:

- set the scrollbar width in the main view and sidebar
- set the scrollbar width and maximum height of code blocks
- set the scrollbar width and maximum height of block embeds

## Future improvements

- detect if the plugin is being loaded in the mobile app in android, and if necessary, don't add the stylesheet (?)
