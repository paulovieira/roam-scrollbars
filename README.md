# roam-scrollbars: a Roam Research extension to show and customize scrollbars

## Introduction

The default CSS loaded by Roam [doesn't show scrollbars](https://github.com/paulovieira/roam-scrollbars/issues/1) in some important places. This extension solves that problem by adding a little bit of minimal css to show the scrollbars again. It also allows you to configure some aspects of scrollbars in Roam, namely:

- set the scrollbar width in the main view and sidebar
- set the scrollbar width and maximum height of code blocks
- set the scrollbar width and maximum height of block/page embeds

This demonstration video gives more details: (coming soon)

## Future improvements

- detect if the plugin is being loaded in the mobile app in android, and if necessary, don't add the stylesheet (?)
- check if the other embeds can also benefit from max-height + scrollbar: PDF embed, Website embed, etc
- what else can be improved? feedback is welcome!
